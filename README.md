# racing-game-making-AI-checkpoint-walls-via-script
In this video we will make a checkpoint path on the race track for AI Cars to follow. We will make making the checkpoint walls easier by using an editor script which will size and angle the walls.   The Checkpoints will have lines drawn between them in scene view for better manual plotting of checkpoints along the track path. Omarvision game programming tutorials, unity game engine.
